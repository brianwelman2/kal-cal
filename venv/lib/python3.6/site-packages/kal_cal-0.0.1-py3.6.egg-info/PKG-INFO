Description: # kal-cal
        ## Kalman Filter and Smoother RI Calibration
        
        **kal-cal** is a Python library developed to provide proof-of-concept tools for *Kalman Filtering and Smoothing Theory* (see [Bayesian Filtering and Smoothing by Simo S ̈arkk ̈a](https://users.aalto.fi/~ssarkka/pub/cup_book_online_20131111.pdf)) as a replacement calibration framework for *Radio-Interoferometric Gains Calibration* (see [Non-linear Kalman Filters for calibration in radio interferometry by Cyril Tasse](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6308)). This library is part of the master's thesis work of *Brian Welman* (@[brianWelman2](https://github.com/brianwelman2) on github) through [Radio Astronomy Techniques and Technologies](http://www.ratt-ru.org/) under [SARAO](https://www.sarao.ac.za/) during the period of 2020 to 2021.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Firstly, you need at least `python3`, or even better `python3.6.9`, as this is the version the library was developed on. Use the package manager [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install **kal-cal** as follows:
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install git+https://github.com/brianwelman2/kal-cal.git
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        To import **kal-cal**:
        ```python
        import kalcal
        ```
        ## Documentation
        *TBD*
        
        ## CI
        This library uses [github-actions](https://travis-ci.org) for continuous integration tests on the same repository.
